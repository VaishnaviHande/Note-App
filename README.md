# Note App

This is a simple web-based Note App that allows you to create, categorize, and manage notes efficiently. The app provides features for searching, editing, and removing notes. It stores all the notes in your browser's localStorage, so your data stays safe even if you close the browser.

## Features
- Create and categorize notes.
- Search notes by keywords.
- Edit or delete existing notes.
- Notes are stored locally in the browser using localStorage.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the app.
- **CSS3 (Grid Layout)**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (DOM manipulation & OOP)**: To handle note operations.
- **localStorage**: For storing notes data on the client-side.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VaishnaviHande/Note-App.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Start creating, editing, and managing your notes.

## How It Works
- The app uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to handle note operations such as adding, editing, and removing.
- Notes are categorized and stored in the browser's localStorage, making the app fast and lightweight.
- You can search for specific notes by typing in the search bar, and the app will filter the results in real-time.
